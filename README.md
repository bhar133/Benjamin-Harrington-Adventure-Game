# Benjamin-Harrington-Adventure-Game
Personal Project: Adventure Game

This was a game I created using a basic graphics package.
It is coded in Java. I implemented basic game controls to be used on a computer
This is a fully functional game where you can finish the game and escape the jungle once you survive and collect the gem.
